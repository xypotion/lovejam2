working late one night at the office, you are nearly done with a graphic design
when you notice the final requirement: "extra large pixels"
*outrage*
oops, made them too big :o start appearing all over office
leave room into hub room -> "aah, they're everywhere already" "hm what are these on the table?" 
> (remote + sheet of basic instructions "use in case of mega-pixels: (activation/use basics)") > "huh. all right."
> note also says "gather vital research documents 1-16 and evacuate premises"
  - or A through P?
do baby puzzles, key appears once first 4 notes are collected
baby puzzles remind player of fusion rules (i guess?), retry, pause, and shift-tab
higher floors' research docs are other stuff:
- backstory? fluff about digital matter? hrm :/ wi
- "please turn off coffee maker" (a joke)
- "shirts are to be worn while working only"

any shirts found think "you found a <color> shirt! wear it with <number>. you can change back to grey with the 1 key"
- plus maybe a spoken comment. "stylish!" "is this cotton?" "black does go with everything." "ooh, tagless" "wait, this isn't made of digital matter, is it?"
- note pinned to invisible shirt indicates its importance and rarity. prototype/ultimate research, etc
