FIXME
- commit music!!!
- text box icon? x_x

TODO in order of importance
! SAVE player's body parts
! shirt controls + progress on pause menu
! what happens in windows when you press Z?
	* it is broken in windows and i assume non-retina macs. could change to non-high-dpi and only zoom by 2?
	  * that works. now just double assets
! final audio: stairs, doors (, item collection, bips for remote)
  - maybe also a siren for cutscenes
! little cleanups in menus
  * remove debug stuff, obvs, including Q to quit
	* maybe user needs to have 7,8,9 pressed to enable debuggery?
	- maybe general code cleanup, too. still a lot of unused stuff & junk print lines
! ...credits somehow. heh
! more puzzles, obvs. would like ~15 total
  - 4~6 "baby" puzzles, the rest semi-hard
! arrange loot nicely
! actually label rooms/doors
! maybe control tweaks? Q -> remote?
  - tap to turn on remote when not using :)
	- Q to turn off remote
! helpful notes when collecting research?
  - and some before, just lying around. OR basic but nonessential ones (pause, reset, etc) come from beginner puzzles
	- mention z for zoom
	- mention p for pause
	- mention auto-save
	- mention shift-tab
! place reminders for controls on pause screen
  - also give away debug mode to player (huh?)
	* shirt shortcuts (1234567890)
> collectible shirts? change colors with tab when not controlling blocks? lol
  - clear shirt is reward for hardest puzzle? kinda ultimate reward?
> postgame fun: all black backgrounds turn into twinkly stars
> better story/cutscenes & effects (like a quake or a siren or a red flash)
> ending
- fade music in/out a little more nicely? hmm
- special endgame hacko to remove plants? F for fire? lol
- better chipset?
- and more still actors for decoration?
  ! potted plants!
	- wall paintings
	- desks & computers?
	- garbage cans
- AND more animated actors/people if you're gonna go all the way with that.
- let player choose hero? lol
? collectible color controls? start with only RGB? hmmm. kind of a distant stretch goal at this point...
? "white warp" for room resets?
> colorblind mode?
? powerups that clear all of one color? heh, not this time. oh, well

done TODOs
> let player choose from 3 sprites, M/F/neutral
  * different skin tones, too?
	* and different hair colors?
	- glasses?
	* more art will be required, but it might actually be pretty easy?
	- could have a special menu where player presses tab to generate a new random character, enter when satisfied
- save after intro cutscene
! less shitty title screen, maybe animated
  - maybe only appears when a save file exists. new game = jump right in
! what to do when there's no save file and they hit continue (new game!)
! audio
	- collide, collect, door, stairs?, elevator?
  - bg music
		* ability to pause music for cutscenes
	- ending/title music?
x save other stuff in save files (zoom and stuff)
