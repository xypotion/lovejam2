FIXME
- zoom :/
- title menu cursor

TODO in order of importance
! what to do when there's no save file and they hit continue (new game!)
! final audio: doors, item collection
  - maybe also a siren for cutscenes. eh.
! less shitty title screen, maybe animated
  - maybe only appears when a save file exists. new game = jump right in
! little cleanups in menus
  * remove debug stuff, obvs, including Q to quit
	* maybe user needs to have 7,8,9 pressed to enable debuggery?
! save other stuff in save files (zoom and stuff)
! ...credits somehow
! more puzzles, obvs. would like ~15 total
! actually label rooms/doors
! helpful notes for collecting research?
  - and some before, just lying around. OR basic but nonessential ones (pause, reset, etc) come from beginner puzzles
	- mention z for zoom
	- mention p for pause
	- mention auto-save
- maybe control tweaks? Q -> remote?
  - tap to turn on remote when not using :)
	- Q to turn off remote
- better chipset?
- and more still actors for decoration?
  ! potted plants!
	- wall paintings
	- desks & computers?
	- garbage cans
- ending
- better story/cutscenes & effects (like a quake or a siren or a red flash)
- arrange more loot nicely
- AND more animated actors/people if you're gonna go all the way with that.
- let player choose hero? lol
? collectible color controls? start with only RGB? hmmm. kind of a distant stretch goal at this point...
? "white warp" for room resets?
? colorblind mode?
