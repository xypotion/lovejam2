FIXME
- zoom :/ (maybe!)

TODO in order of importance
! what happens in windows when you press Z?
  - if broken just disable zoom, i guess. oh, well
! final audio: doors, item collection, bips for remote
  - maybe also a siren for cutscenes. eh.
! little cleanups in menus
  * remove debug stuff, obvs, including Q to quit
	* maybe user needs to have 7,8,9 pressed to enable debuggery?
	- maybe general code cleanup, too. still a lot of unused stuff & junk print lines
! ...credits somehow
! more puzzles, obvs. would like ~15 total
! actually label rooms/doors
! helpful notes for collecting research?
  - and some before, just lying around. OR basic but nonessential ones (pause, reset, etc) come from beginner puzzles
	- mention z for zoom
	- mention p for pause
	- mention auto-save
- postgame fun: all black backgrounds turn into twinkly stars
  - also give away debug mode to player
- fade music in/out a little more nicely? hmm
- let player choose from 3 sprites, M/F/neutral
  * different skin tones, too?
	* and different hair colors?
	- glasses?
	* more art will be required, but it might actually be pretty easy?
	- could have a special menu where player presses tab to generate a new random character, enter when satisfied
- special endgame hacko to remove plants? F for fire? lol
- collectible shirts? change colors with tab when not controlling blocks? lol
  - clear one is reward for hardest puzzle?
- maybe control tweaks? Q -> remote?
  - tap to turn on remote when not using :)
	- Q to turn off remote
- save after intro cutscene?
- better chipset?
- and more still actors for decoration?
  ! potted plants!
	- wall paintings
	- desks & computers?
	- garbage cans
- ending
- better story/cutscenes & effects (like a quake or a siren or a red flash)
- arrange more loot nicely
- AND more animated actors/people if you're gonna go all the way with that.
- let player choose hero? lol
? collectible color controls? start with only RGB? hmmm. kind of a distant stretch goal at this point...
? "white warp" for room resets?
? colorblind mode?
? powerups that clear all of one color? heh, not this time. oh, well
